# SIR-models

Built SIR models to quantify the impact of political and 10+ socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 transmission. Implemented Bayesian, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Regression methods in R and Python
		 	 	 		
This project studies the factors that affect the spread of COVID- 19 in the U.S. Special attention will be paid to three aspects: 
(1) government interventions:lock down, travel restriction, mask wearing;
(2) socio-economic factors: age, income, education, household size, health resources, population density; 
(3) public events:holiday, school closure and reopen. 

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive predictive model for the trends of COVID-19. Based on our literature review, some research used various statistical models, including SIR models, generalized logistic growth models, and sub-epidemic wave models to forecast the COVID-19 outbreaks in a short term.  We are interested in incorporating the factors,(1) government interventions; (2) socio-economic factors; (3) public events.,  into this forecasting model.

The research project will provide a quantitative tool to fight against the disease and better prepare for the anticipated surges in the future waves. It does not only give policy makers insight into the spread of the virus, but also provides healthcare systems guidance on the trend forecasting of the pandemic.This project also helps us provide effective responses and robust plans for potential future pandemics.
